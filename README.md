# You Choose The Size
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows you to choose the size of the board.

## How to Play
1. Choose the size of the board. You have to enter a number between 1 and 10 inclusive (it's the number of rows and columns).
2. The game will display the board with the chosen size.
3. Take turns with a friend to place your marks (X or O) on the board.
4. The first player to get three (for a board of size 3) marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
5. If the board is full and no player has three marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
6. You can choose to play again or exit the game.
